Discord Bot Project:

1) First step is to find a server to put the bot in:
2) Then go to the discord developer portal: [https://discord.com/build/app-developers](url)  Go here and click get started
3) Create a new bot and add admin privileges:
4) Then copy the Token save this somewhere easy to access and safe:
5) To run this project on your computer make sure to install homebrew: [https://docs.brew.sh/Installation](url)
6) Make sure you have the most recent version of pip:
7) I also faced an issue with the pyvips package installation, so I switched to cairosvg. To install all the necessary packages: 
pip install discord
pip install os
pip install random
pip install requests
pip install time
pip install chess
pip install chess.svg
pip install sys
pip install stockfish
pip install time
pip install cairo svg
8) First get your discord token and replace with GO_GET_YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN:
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN='GO_GET_YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN'
9) If all the packages are installed correctly, then go to terminal locate main.py and run it with:
python main.py
